If you vote 1 for:

- [Nicolette Boele](https://www.nicoletteboele.com.au/) (Independent) or
- [Janine Kitson](https://www.bradfieldcandobetter.org/) (Independent) or
- [Martin Cousins](https://greens.org.au/nsw/person/martin-cousins) (Greens)

Then you should vote 2 and 3 for the others.

That way, everyone who votes 1 for any of those candidates, will be helping all of them.

> Use your preferences to maximum effect in Bradfield this 2022 federal election!

[Bradfield](https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2022/guide/brfd) &ndash; covering Sydney's Upper North Shore, particularly the Ku-ring-gai LGA &ndash; is one of the safest COALition seats in Australia. If we are to have any chance of overturning it, we have to work together.

If you feel that you need to, then [brush up](https://youtu.be/HaE6MigXYdY) on [how preferential voting works](https://www.aec.gov.au/learn/preferential-voting.htm) in Australia.

[The Juice Media's Preferential Voting](https://youtu.be/bleyX4oMCgM) video is also recommended viewing (warning: contains coarse language).

This publication is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, any political candidate nor by any political party. It was not authored by anyone who is directly involved with any candidate's election campaign.

It is the work of a life-long Bradfield resident who would really like to see one of those candidates win the seat in the upcoming 2022 federal election. In order for that to happen, a tactical, pragmatic approach to voting is needed.
